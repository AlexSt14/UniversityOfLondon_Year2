# UniversityOfLondon_Year2
Second year of University repository for projects <br>

- C++ Unit Testing --> [My first interaction with unit testing in C++](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/C%2B%2B%20Unit%20testing) <br>
Short project about C++ Unit Testing using cppUnit (which is now deprecated/not supported) <br>
- OOP Final Assignment DJ Application --> [Object Oriented Programming assignment of a DJ Application](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/DJApp%20Project) <br>
Developed using Visual Studio 2022. It was created with Juce 8 using Projucer. <br>
It promotes Object Oriented Programming and encapsulation. <br>
- Graphics Programming Final Assignment --> [Manipulation of the pixel array for filters using p5.js and ML5.js for ML detection such as faces and hands](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/DJApp%20Project) <br>
It does include some OOP aspects. <br>
It was developed using p5.js, alongside ML5.js for machine learning face and hands detection. It runs in a browser and was developed to use as little resources as possible, only manipulating the pixel array when necessary. <br>
- Graphics Programming Mini Projects --> [Small projects created during the module, from image filters to physics](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/Grahpics%20Programming%20and%20Physics) <br>
- Javascript web API unit testing --> [Unit testing an API using Javascript with chai and mocha](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/JS%20Web%20API%20Unit%20testing/norestforthewiccad) <br>
- OOP Midterm Assignment --> [Weather presentation and prediction running in console](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/OOPWeatherMidterm) <br>
It was developed with C++ and has strong Object Oriented Programming aspects. <br>
It runs in console, it presents weather data for countries in Europe. It uses a database of weather statistics since 1980 to create candlesticks for each year, for each country. <br>
You are able to filter the weather data by country and by years. You are also able to predict the weather for one year ahead. <br>

- Python Unit Testing --> [Some unit testing with Python](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year2/tree/main/Python%20Unit%20Testing)
